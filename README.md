## What the heck is Glitch?
Glitch references a Canadian computer-animated TV series that originally aired on YTV from 1994 to 2001 called ReBoot. A Glitch is a Key Tool from the Super Computer that can become most objects. It can hear its Guardian (the main character named Bob) from great distances and can interface with other software, such as a system paint program.

It's a gadget that helped Bob do stuff, so in that sense, this is a tool that will help you do stuff.
